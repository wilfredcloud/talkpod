        One of my big dream is to build a voice and video conferencing application. This lead to the development of 
        talkpod which is the future of voice conferencing, designed to empower individuals and organizations to connect, collaborate, and communicate seamlessly. With a commitment to delivering unparalleled audio quality and a suite of powerful features, Talkpod redefines what it means to hold productive meetings, webinars, and group discussions in today's fast-paced world.
